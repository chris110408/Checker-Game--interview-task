#### requirement:
Treat it like production code.

At the very least, it should have most of the MVPs and deployed on Heroku, AWS, or other PaaS.

The project should have a clean architecture, maintainable/scalable code, and well commented/documented. Additionally, you should make frequent commits to the repository with a concise commit title based on the code change.

##### Prompt

The candidate should attempt replicate the classic Checker boardgame.
##### Hint

Take one task at a time and carefully look at the requirement. Do not over complicate things.
##### MVP

Checkered board
Circle piece
Square piece
A piece should be movable (be creative)
When a circle piece reached an edge, it should transform into a square piece
The game should automatically save before the browser close (don't use clientside storage)
A reset button, when clicked, the game will reset

##### React React this project is used React, Mongodb ,Eggjs, and Node. 

For Front end, I used Umijs (Pluggable enterprise-level react application framework.)

For Backend I used Eggjs,instead Express. It is Node & KOA,  and it tested and it has been used  for building enterprise application and framework. and it is really easy to deploy.
